A sample [[https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog][CLOG]] application setup to run on Heroku.

** This is

- A copy of a CLOG tutorial.
- A simple demonstration of deploying a CLOG app.
- Should support other lisps but only test with SBCL.

** This is not

- A universal template.
- Set of best practices.

** Heroku specific notes

- ~heroku-compile.lisp~ ensure our application loads during build.
- ~application.lisp~ acts as the server's entry point to the application
- You must bundle static assets with the project and supply them as ~:static-root~ to ~initialize~. See ~src/main.lisp~ for a example.
- You must include ~clack-handler-hunchentoot~ and ~hunchentoot~ as explicit dependencies. The app will not start without these.

** Heroku setup

- Use [[https://gitlab.com/bendersteed/heroku-buildpack-common-lisp][heroku-buildpack-common-lisp]] as your buildpack. This one has support for multiple lisps (including SBCL).
- Set Heroku environment variable ~CL_IMPL: sbcl-bin~.
